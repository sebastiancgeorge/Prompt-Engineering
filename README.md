# üß† Day 2 ‚Äì Prompt Engineering 101: Crafting Better Prompts for Smarter AI

Welcome to **Day 2** of my **#100DaysOfAI** challenge!  
Today I explored the essential skill of **Prompt Engineering** ‚Äî learning to communicate more effectively with AI systems like GPT-4.

## üß™ Prompt Styles Covered

| Prompt Style          | Description                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero-shot Prompting   | No examples ‚Äî just the task in one go                     |
| Few-shot Prompting    | Provide 1‚Äì3 examples to guide the AI                      |
| Role-based Prompting  | Assign a role or persona to the model                     |
| Instructional Prompting | Give clear step-by-step instructions                     |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The script sends four different prompts to GPT-4 for the same task: translating a sentence.
2. Each prompt type is crafted to demonstrate the difference in output style and accuracy.
3. The script prints the response for each prompt style.
